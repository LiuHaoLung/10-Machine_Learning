    "#### Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called a linear regression, each independent variable is multiplied by a coefficient and summed up to predict the value.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No endogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically this is expressed as the covariance of the error and the x' is 0 for any error or x.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normality and homoscedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality means the error term is normally distributed, the expected value of the error is 0 as we expect to have no errors on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity means constant variance.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically the covariance of any two error terms is 0, this is the assumption that would usually stop you from using a linear regression in your analysis.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity is observed when two or more variables have a high correlation between each other."
