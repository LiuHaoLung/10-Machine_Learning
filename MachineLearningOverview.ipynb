    "### What is Machine Learning？\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using algorthms that iteratively learn from data , machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to work.\n",

    "### Machine Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1. Data Acquisition：\n",
    "\n",
    "    The data is going to have a lot of features based off whatever you trying to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2. Data Cleaning：\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let the data have a nice format and allow to using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3. Split Data：\n",
    "\n",
    "    Iterate through the 3-1 & 3-2 in order to tune the model to best fit both the training data and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3-1. Model Training & Building：\n",
    "        Train the Maching Learning Model on training data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    3-2. Test Data：\n",
    "        Test the model on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4. Model Testing：\n",
    "\n",
    "    Test the model througe the test data and model training & building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5. Model Deployment：\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The whole steps are ready then can deploy the model.\n",
    "_____\n",
    "### There are 3 main types of Machine Learning algorithms：\n",
    "#### Supervised Learning：\n",
    "\n",
    "You have labeled data and are trying to predict a label based off of known features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Such as an input or the desired output is known.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Then modifies the model accordingly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. More methods like classfication,regression,prediction and gradient boosting.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Use patterns to predict the values of the label on additional unlabeled data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. Commonly used in application where historical data predicts likely future events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unspervised Learning：\n",
    "_____\n",
    "You have unlabeled data and trying to group together similar data points based off of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. It is used against data that has no historical labels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. The system is not told the \"right answer\", it must figure out what is being shown.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. The goal is to explore the data and find some sort of structure within the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Can find the main attributes that separate customer segments from each other.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. More methods like self-organizing maps,nearest-neighbor mapping,k-means clustering and singular value decomposition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. These methods are used to segment text topics,recommend items and identify data outliers.\n",
    "_____    \n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning：\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms learns to perform an action based off of previous experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Often used for robotics gaming and navigation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. The algorithm discovers through trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. This type of learning has three primary components：\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. The agent(the learner or decision maker).\n",
    "        2. The environment(everything the agent interacts with).\n",
    "        3. Actions(what the agent can actually do or perform).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. The object is for the agent to choose actions that max the expected reward over a given amount of time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. The agent will reach the goal much faster by following a good policy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. The goal is to learn the best policy."
