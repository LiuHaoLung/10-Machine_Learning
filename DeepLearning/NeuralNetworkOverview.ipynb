    "#### What is Neural Network  ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Netural networks are modeled after biological neural networks and attempt to allow computer to learn in a similar manner humans through reinforcement learning.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neural Network use cases ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pattern Recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Time Series Predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Signal Processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Anomaly Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Control.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic of Neural Network is ?\n",
    "\n",
    "It it come from the human brain, just like the brain has interconnected neurons with dendrites that receive inputs, and then based on those inputs, produce an electrical signal output through the axom.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this concept that going to be trying to recreate through artifical neural networks.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why to develop Neural Networks ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These are problems that are difficult for humans but easy for computers(calculating large arithmetic problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then there are problems easy for human, but difficult for computers(recognizing a picture of a person from the side).\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurla Networks attempt to solve problems that would normally easy for humans but hard for computers.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Perceptron ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron follows the 'feed-forward' model, meaning inputs are sent into the neuron, are processe, and result in an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron process follows 4 main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receive inputs.\n",
    "2. Weight inputs.\n",
    "3. Sum inputs.\n",
    "4. Generate Output.\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the processing of the perceptron ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have many inputs.\n",
    "2. Weighted, each input that is sent into the neuron first be weighted, multiplied by some value(often a number between -1 and 1).\n",
    "3. So when creating a perceptron, it will typically begin by assigning random weights.\n",
    "4. When have the inputs and weighted, we take each input and multiply it by its weight.\n",
    "5. The output of a perceptron is generated by passing that sum through an activation function. In the case of a simple binary output, the activation function is what tells the perceptron whether to fire or not. There are many activation functions to choose from(Logistic, Trigonometirc etc), so make the activation function the sign of the sum. In other words, if the sum is a positive number, the output is 1, if it is negative, the output is -1.\n",
    "6. One more thing is to consider Bias, if the input are equal to zero, then no matter what multiplicative weight would also be zero,\n",
    "7. So it need to input the Bias in order to avoid this situation.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train the perceptron use the following steps are :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide the perceptron with inputs for which there is a known answer.\n",
    "2. Ask the perceptron to guess an answer.\n",
    "3. Compute the error, to know how far off from the correct answer?\n",
    "4. Adjust all the weights according to the error.\n",
    "5. Return to Step 1 and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat this until we reach an error we are satisfied with(we set this before hand).\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Neural Network layers ?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have an input layer and an output layer, and between this two layer have a hidden layer, but you don't directly see anything but the input of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms of 'Deep Learning', this is just a Neural Network with many hidden layders, so causing it to be deep."
