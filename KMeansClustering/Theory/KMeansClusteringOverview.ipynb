    "#### What is the K Means Clustering do ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. K Means Clustering is unsurpervised learning algorithm meaning it takes an unlabeled data and it is goint to attempt to group similar clusters together in this data.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### What is K Means Clustering over goal ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The over goal is to divide data into distinct groups such that observations within each group are similar.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### How is the K Means Clustering algorithm work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a number of clusters 'K'.\n",
    "2. Randomly assign each point to a cluster.\n",
    "3. Until clusters stop changing, repeat the follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For each cluster, compute the cluster centroid by taking the mean vector of points in the cluster, initially the centroid are almost overlapping, because the initial cluster assignments were random)\n",
    "    * Assign each data point to the cluster for which the centroid is the closet.\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### How to choose a K value ?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no easy answer of choosing a 'best' K value, one way is the elbow method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First of all, compute the sum of squared error(SSE) for some values of K (for example 2,4,6,8 etc).\n",
    "2. The SSE is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each membrt of the cluster and its centroid.\n",
    "3. Whem plot K against the SSE, you will see that the error decreases as K gets larger, this is because when the number of clusters increase, they should be smaller, so distortion is alse smaller."
